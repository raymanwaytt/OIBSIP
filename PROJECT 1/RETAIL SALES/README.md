### **1. Data Exploration and Preparation**

#### **Initial Data Exploration (Python)**
- **Objective:** Understand the dataset and assess its quality.
- **Steps Taken:**
  1. Used `.isnull().sum()` to check for missing values in the dataset, ensuring data completeness.
  2. Leveraged `.describe()` to calculate descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) to gain insights into numerical columns.
- **Outcome:** Confirmed the dataset was clean and ready for analysis with no significant missing values.

#### **Data Transformation (Power BI)**
- **Objective:** Enhance the dataset with calculated columns to enable more in-depth analysis.
- **Steps Taken:**

  **1. Age Group:**
  - Created an Age Group column to categorize customers into ranges:
    ```DAX
    Age Group = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] >= 18 && 'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] <= 25, "18-25",
        'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] >= 26 && 'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] <= 35, "26-35",
        'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] >= 36 && 'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] <= 45, "36-45",
        'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] >= 46 && 'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] <= 55, "46-55",
        "56+"
    )
    ```

  **2. Age Group Sort:**
  - Added a sorting column to ensure Age Group categories were displayed in logical order:
    ```DAX
    Age Group Sort = 
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] >= 18 && 'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] <= 25, 1,
        'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] >= 26 && 'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] <= 35, 2,
        'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] >= 36 && 'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] <= 45, 3,
        'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] >= 46 && 'retail_sales_dataset'[Age] <= 55, 4,
        5
    )
    ```

  **3. Day of Week:**
  - Extracted the day of the week from the transaction date:
    ```DAX
    Day of Week = FORMAT(retail_sales_dataset[Date].[Date], "dddd")
    ```

- **Outcome:** The dataset was enhanced with Age Group, Age Group Sort, and Day of Week columns, enabling more targeted demographic and temporal analysis.
